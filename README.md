THIS README WAS GENERATED BY THE REPOSITORY IT IS DESCRIBING. Readme_Generator uses a series of prompts given to the user and handled by "axios" and "inquirer" to create an object containing the user's input as well as data retrieved from a github API call using the user's input. This input data is put into the buildReadme function that is imported from the second javascript file. this function loops through each object key and adds the appropriate key and or attribute to the first string, which holds the tile, description, and 2 badges, the table of contents, which provide links to the sections included by the user, and the second string, which contains the anchor tags for the table of contents as well as the section title and information. these when done, these strings are combined and returned.This completed template is then saved as a readme to the current folder.

## <a name ="Installation"></a> Installation
This project requires axios, inquirer, and node.It also requires index.js and generatemarkdown.js to be in the same folder to work without changing export adresses. 

      
## <a name ="Usage"></a> Usage
To run the Readme Generator, open up the folder containing index.js in terminal or gitbash. then type "node index.js".It will then ask you a series of questions and promps. IMPORTANT: For some features to work, such as project github links and badges, GITHUB USERNAME AND PROJECT NAME MUST MATCH THEIR COUNTERPART ON GITHUB. any text input prompts left blank will not be added to table of contents and will not have a section listed on the file. More input questions for building new sections linked to the table of contents can be added to the question array so long as the Name key is Capitalized. 

      
## <a name ="License"></a> License
Use freely

      
## <a name ="Contributing"></a> Contributing
Any added question outputs will not be used normally for direct template making unless the "name" key's attribute is Capitalized, in which case the output key becomes a section title and the attribute becomes the text underneath. other inputs can however, be used called to add data to templates without making an exeption in the object loop.

      
## <a name ="Tests"></a> Tests
